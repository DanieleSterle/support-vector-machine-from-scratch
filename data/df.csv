10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"The greatest multiplayer shooter experience I've had since Quake 1. The e-sport scene also helped it alot, it's the only computer game I've really followed when it comes to e-sports (back when I followed the CPL etc). The design of the game was simple but very effective and delivered a multiplayer experience that few other games can match. The Call of Duty and Battlefield titles, although good in their own right, never drew me in like Counter-Strike.",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"Back when Counter-Strike was good. Of all games in this series, the other games aren't as complete as this one. Though this game maybe feels outdated, it does pack alot of fun for anyone who is a fan of FPS games. The FPS function in this game is superb and it feels great to get headshots and so on. If you're intrested in this game and if you're fully aware of what you are getting in to, then get it!",1,0
10,Counter-Strike,Old school game.,1,0
10,Counter-Strike,"1999 is when this came out, but when I was born. Gladly though I grew up to find out and discover about this magnificent piece. There was no other game that I played once I purchased this with some B-Day cash on Steam. First time playing, I got mutilated like the noob I was, but when I started playing more often, I became better and everyone else can too.   This isn't like the CODs or Battlefields that I have played here and there today. No it's much more different. Counter-Strike is a Tactical FPS which relies on teamwork and tactics more than fast paced arcade action. You don't unlock weapons, you buy them with cash earned from kiling enemies, completeing objectives, or winning rounds although you still get a little for loosing. Think of the game as Cops &amp; Robbers. Robbers blow things up and the Cops don't them too.  On the extra note, this game has probably one of the best modding communities out there. There too much to do or put in here but I can slam a bit down. -Zombies Survival/Escape -Soccer (Or Football for the Europeans) -Surf -Bhop/KZ (Climbing Zone) -Pokemod -Gungame (Those new may have heard such from Call of Duty's spinoff) -And more, etc.  So now that I've explained the game I guess I can lay down some pro's yet con's to playing Counter-Strike 1.6  PROS -Fun/Unlimited Gameplay possibilities -Booming community that has been alive for 15 years -Plethora of servers to choose from -Competetive and Casual at the same time -Fun to play with a group of friends -More skill based than many other games out there -Cheap price   CONS -Graphics from 1998 may seem slightly offputting -Not an easy game to jump right into, as it takes lots of time to become better -May seem repetitive after a while  I came into CS late. But, I'm glad this was the first one I owned.",1,0

I'm so sorry that there are too much cheaters on servers, but if Valve can make it better , it would be great :D Remember old good times, waiting to start a new match between Na'Vi and fNatic &lt;3 And all other teams... Then somebody made a cheat, and destroyed a game. This game changed many lives, many people. I think this game become the world best game ever. For me, it's the best game. I play it every day, but it isn't like sometimes. Now graphic is important. Well, it isn't. I know that this game is dead already... I want to get it back, but there is no way to do that.  Cheaters are everywhere now. In every single game. You can buy cheat for CS:GO for 5$ I think... My friend bought it. I asked him : ' Why did you bought that ? Isn't it better to enjoy playing the game without cheats? ' He told me: ' I want to beat everyone. I want to be the best. No one can stop me now. '  I don't know why are you doing it, this is beautiful game. When I played it for the first time, it was awesome :D Finally a game that I can play with my friends on LAN. And, till today, I'm playing it. I never downloaded a cheat. I don't need that. I want to learn how to play, to be the beast in the world... Now everyone is wanting money, money money... I heard about CS:GO Lounge aka CS GO betting site. Now everyone is watching matches because of skins, to get free money... Well, when I was young, in 2005. I waited with my friends a CS 1.6 match. It was beautiful. Now i sit here, and watch this CS:GO matches... So many people watch matches... But 90% watch them because of f***ing bet...  It will never be like sometimes... Or we can change everything...  Valve please, get this game back to life &lt;3  Thanks.",1,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike - a series of computer games in the genre of team first-person shooter based on the engine GoldSource, originally appeared as a modification of Half-Life games.  You have to compare, so this game I will compare with СS: Source and CS: Global Offensive    Pros:    1. Battle PVP.   The multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential of the idea of the game. The most interesting part of this is. Under the bot can already tune in, but not in the real players. They can deceive, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes.   2. The atmosphere and realism.   In all games, Valve is always a great atmosphere and I was impressed. It is evident that the developers have tried to do everything in this game, as in real life. For example, the sounds. Unfortunately, Valve released a patch in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with new sounds and they made a .       Minuses:    1. Cheaters.   Well, as without these s? These sons of dogs prevent us from playing. Creators of cheats have always been one step ahead of the creators of the VAC anti-cheat. Valve is trying to improve its anti-cheat and have it turns out.I say that Valve do nothing, not worth it.   2.Graphic arts.   She was good at Counter-Strike as long as did not come out Source. I'm not picky about graphics, but after 30 minutes I start to hurt your eyes. Yes, and in general, this game proved to all that the graphics in games are not the most important thing.   3.Termination of support.   All good things always come to an end, and Counter-Strike is not an exception. The game goes more and more players, server empty.More Valve does not release an update for Counter-Strike and does not support it in e-sports.     Conclusion:     Despite the fact that in this game there are downsides, even if they have, but still this game is legendary.  If you ask me, as you Counter-Strike, the fond memories flooding back me, maybe I can cry .Game, which was able to give me a lot of positive emotions..  ",1,0

Graphics wise, you have to be able to run this. If you can't run CS at all, not sure why you have Steam. Simple, and basic is what a lot of people would describe the look and feel of CS to be.  If you haven't played HL original it make look a little stupid, but the game is still great inside. Original can't get more original here -- when talking about the base game idea(s).  Great for people with low end comps and internet like Link Freeman and his dial up. This game was made a while back so keep that in mind!  7/10",1,0

That's a fact, but that doesn't mean you should play this. We have CSGO now, it would be ridiculous to pick up a old, outdated and dying game like CS 1.6. Those who play it do so cause they've been doing it for 15+ years, but no new players arrive and it is too much blocky graphically to be even considered for purchase these days.  Great game, but too old/outdated and dying. Don't recommend, unless you're here to get some nostalgia from the old days.

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike was one of the first video games I have ever played and will always be up there in my list of favorite games.  I had just installed it. It was my first multiplayer game and I though I'm too new to play against players so I played only with bots slowly progressing from easy to to the hard ones. Then one day I joined a Dust II DM server. It was chaotic, but fun. I didn't even know the map then, but I learned it by playing lots of DM. I slowly climbed the integrated server ranks and made friends with one of the admins...then after a while the server disappeared.  After that I found out about deathrun. I was horrible at it, but the regulars helped me and I started visiting the server more and more. Apparently the same server chain had a gun game server too. Now that was amazing. Completely different people played there, but again friendly ones. After a couple of months the server chain was shut down...  I continued playing aim, awp, jailbreak and other mods. I didn't even play the classic mode, it wasn't of that big interest to me, though after a couple of months I stopped playing CS.  I can't not recommend this game, because I have so many memories from it. Nostalgia.",1,0

10130,TimeShift,"Didn't expect much from it but got a fun, fast paced and linear 10 hour campaign. The story is almost nonexistent and is pretty much just an excuse to run around and murder people with time manipulation mechanics. Your health regenerates and there are no pickups other than enemy dropped weapons and the occasional weapon chest, so you'll just be going forward all the time and obliterating everything on your way, which I usually find boring but the TimeShifting mechanics make it very enjoyable. I definitely recommend getting it on a sale.  WARNING: I tried running this game a few years ago on a machine with an AMD GPU and the game stuttered so much it was unplayable. It now works perfectly on my new Nvidia GPU, so be warned, it may not work on AMD GPUs!",1,0

10130,TimeShift,"And here we come to one more underrated game. I played this game in 2008 but dropped it soon after I started. And the reason was poor storytelling. This time I was more patient and clever.   Well, firs thing first: now I tell you what this game actually about. Our protagonist works in some very advanced research facility where they develop suits which can manipulate time. But it is clearly understandable is he a scientist or some kind of science CIA agent to watch over scientists do not use their inventions in some 'improper' way like your antagonist did. And head of research team was one badass scientist named Krone who stole of suits, blew up the facility, jumped back in time and made himself a dictator. Well, he oppressed the people, and the was a rebellion. And we jumped in time to the end of the rebellion.  This is the moment you star playing this game and you see only grey concrete around, ugly city, revolutionaries who look like hobos and terrorists, you get some  pistol and machine gun, you cannot manipulate time, you get a feeling that you constantly loosing and finally you see how rebellion...failed.   This is the time when fun starts. Your suit sends you back in time several days before the rebellion. And you get a shotgun and grenades and this grenades are sticky...and electricizing. The stick to an enemy and he is screaming 'Oh, my god explosives. Hit the deck' while been bitten by electric current and then BAM! And now you can manipulate time: stop, reverse and slow. Well you user 'reverse' to get to some places to advance in the game, 'slow' is for slow motion as in every other game except everything you do happen in usual timeline, for example you throw a grenade in 'slow' and while enemies run in slo-mo and scream in slow-mo it explodes with usual speed, and with 'stop' you can come to bunch of enemies and take their weapons from their hands and the listen how they say kinda 'well, dude, you see we are unarmed so...move along'.   And you storm prison and stronghold. And you get sniper rifle and rocket launcher and crossbow with exploding bolts and hand cannon with exploding ammo and machine gun with flammable ammo and electro gun. And you meet enemies with jetpacks, kinetic shield enemies, enemies who can manipulate time and teleport enemies and enemy heavy walker and helicopters. And then you hijack big flyers...well, a lot of stuff will happen in this game. And with all this stuff you kinda do some corrections to the course of rebellion and for it outcome.  And exploding barrels! LOTS OF THEM!!!  But still because of poor storytelling you will keep asking yourself: who are these people around you? why are you with them? why? why?  So if you put aside shady beginning, lack of storytelling and sudden end it is 2007 rail shooter at best. 7/10.",1,0
10130,TimeShift,"I first played this game after it was just released, 7 years ago. I just played it through again and it still feels like a great and new game. The gameplay is fun (manipulate time!), the graphics are decent though my standards for good graphics are CS:S-like.   The only thing I missed back in 2007 was the lack of people on multiplayer, which now is basically unexisting.   I can recommend this game to everyone who wants to play a SinglePlayer game with a good/fun story and medium-paced gameplay. The puzzles aren't complicated yet keep you entertained, the story missions are well fun and worth playing through multiple times. This game deserves the 71/100 metascore and I'd give it around 7.5/10 myself.",1,0

The gameplay is fun (manipulate time!), the graphics are decent though my standards for good graphics are CS:S-like.   The only thing I missed back in 2007 was the lack of people on multiplayer, which now is basically unexisting.   I can recommend this game to everyone who wants to play a SinglePlayer game with a good/fun story and medium-paced gameplay. The puzzles aren't complicated yet keep you entertained, the story missions are well fun and worth playing through multiple times. This game deserves the 71/100 metascore and I'd give it around 7.5/10 myself.",1,0

10130,TimeShift,"So i did some research and found that this game crashes if you enable interlacing, which is something that has to do with your gpu and how it streams its data that almost every modern gpu uses by default, which has to be changed in the B.I.O.S. Which makes it confusing how I managed to play about a half an hour of this before it crashed in game, and loading a save only made it crash again during the loading screen, and the community seems to not have a fix for it. Starting a new game also didn't work in case you didn't think I tried. Downvoting until i hear it's fixed, odds are with a game this old now it will never happen. Really fun though, controller pretty much necessary.  Edit: So I looked at this review and realized that I pretty much didn't cover any of the game I actually played, so in short, it has some decent puzzle elements, like stopping a fan blade over a death pit and walking across per say, or walking up to a dude, taking his gun and punching him in the face. You would not believe how much fun that is until you try it. I've played through most of the game on my friends ps3, which is why I picked it up, however I'm still dissapointed that there isn't a solution for my problem no matter how hard I look, considering my BIOS is apparently crap and I don't have interlacing options. This is a good game, and I reccomend picking it up, just not on PC, I hate to say it.",-1,0
10130,TimeShift,"This game is the dictionary definition of mediocre. While there is nothing blantantly wrong with it, it does not excel in any department either. Being able to control time at will sounds like a great mechanic but it is poorly implemented in this game. During combat all you need to do is slow down time and you become virtually untouchable. which takes away any sort of tension during firefights. It seems the develepers tried to account for this by making enemy fire highly lethal (meaning a couple of shots to the face and you're dead), and by having enemies ambush you -- as if they come out of nowhere -- resulting in constant reloadings back to the previous checkpoint. Even having purchased this game on sale I cannot recommended it since, despite giving it an honest try, it offers no entertainment value. ",-1,0

Game has its lenghts (even if it´s only 10 hours on medium...or as they call it 'hard')- you run around from checkpoint to checkpoint, kill some enemies, do some minor task - and that´s it.  If you don´t move over a certain line the enemy doesn´t engage you.  Game mechanics are fine. Even for today graphics, and effects are good - not outrageously excellent, but very solid.

10130,TimeShift,"Il start by saying that after so many delays on release for this game at the time, for the ones who played the first Demo, it was clear that the devs polished the game before release to give a better overall experience, the players that come in touch with the game now may not see it, but the game now have nothing in common with that Demo besides the 2 levels played since the game mechanics improved greatly and shame that a sequel was discarded by Activision short after release since not all games are like CoD, good or bad the sales seem unaffected.  The game mechanics are the strong point of Timeshift, the ability to stop time, provide you endless possibilitys, being for advancing in story or just muck around with the enemys, is just plain fun, enemys provide enough challenge on higher dificulty and at some point can even be frustrating when facing the enemys armed with beast that fire explosive arrows.  The story is interesting enough to complement the game and graphics are good if we look at release date for this game (no point making comparations with games now days), the sound and voice acting are also good and help imersing the game, since at points feel like a belivable world.  Depending on how people are used to play shooters, the campaing takes something like 8h to 10h since the game is pretty linear with some areas with more freedom to diferent approach, if you can get this on sale, it definetly worth the time and money for a good laughs looking at helpless enemys stopped in time.",1,0

I can safely say that even now, it still gives me that amazed feeling(even though pc controls are a bit difficult for me). The gameplay is good. The time manipulation mechanic works to keep combat fresh, as well as a puzzle solving tool. It reminds me a lot of Half-Life 2 not only in the gameplay, but the story as well(minus the time manipulation stuff). It looks nice, even on the lowest settings and my dinosaur of a computer can still run it fine. It is a bit dated, I mean it was made in 2007 so what can you expect? I would definitely recommend giving it try for $5.00. I'm not sure if it's worth the full $20.00 price though.... Havn't played much, but I'd give it a 8/10 so far.",1,1

The story is pretty good,my only problem is with the Villain, he is cool but he never really addresses you until the last stage.

10130,TimeShift,"I honestly do not understand how others can give such good reviews, though that may be explained by the fact that EVERY negative review, no matter how well founded and well written is marked as unhelpful, when many are very accurate. I found this game clunky and quite silly in some respects. A major issue I had is the number of bullets you must put into enemies, though there is at least enough ammo dropped to refund you there. But when it takes vital extra seconds to make sure they're definitely dead after that nearly 20 bullets point-blank, that then causes you to die repeatedly from the sheer volume of AI surrounding you, that each seem able to severely cripple you, then it becomes rather annoying. The controls are not exactly set up the best as default either, and it doesn't help when you have to use those strange controls to stop the game using the 'amazing' time powers (which are not able to be utilised as well as they could) for you and wasting the charge on them, as well as throwing off any rhythm you manage to achieve. Overall, though it has potential to be enjoyed, and I am sure many can, I do not reccomend it for those reasons, as I believe that it has not the quality to have enough fun to be worth it. Feel free to try, however, as it may get better later in the game. I couldn't bother to continue after a while.",-1,1
10130,TimeShift,"I could only play three levels of this game. I think by that admission we know where this review is going.   I don't know why I bought this game, if it was in a bundle, or if I mistook it for another time game, what ever the reasons, I wish I could give it back. It's not that it's a horrendous game, but with a name like Timeshift, you have a lot of great possible features that will blow a players mind.   This game though doesn't do any of them. This is a very by the numbers shooters with a time power that is almost mandatory. In the first three levels, you constantly feel overwhelmed, but the time power doesn't really make up for it, a lot of this game is use the time power, shoot a few people, hide again wait for the time power (And health) regen, do it again.   The abilities you have in the game are interesting, but the game overall is quite uninteresting. The story is weak, the gameplay is about the same, and the graphics... well the first level is a dull grey, with enemies running around, and while there's big enemies you can't fight (yet?) overall you're running around dull hallways, shooting dull enemies, running in parks, in drab environments, shooting dull enemies, the game never really evolves beyond the dull lack luster experience that it starts with.  Who knows, the fourth level might be the best level in video games ever, but I couldn't stay interested long enough to e even reach it.

10130,TimeShift,"Competent, yet completely average and uninspired shooter. Ultimately, Timeshift feels just gimmicky - and it exhausts it's bag of tricks very fast. I had fun shooting an explosive bolt into a guy's head with time frozen and watching him suddenly become inert gibs. A couple of the weapon are very interesting, regardless - a submachine gun with incendiary rounds and attached flamethrower was different enough to become a favorite -, but their designs are, again, uninspired (What the hell is that assault rifle?!), and the audio and feedback lacks any punch (though the shotgun WILL send people flying... after maybe two or three shots at close range.) The game quickly devolved into slow-motion dashing through cover while waiting for the limited time-resource to recharge. In the end, Timeshift didn't offer enough freedom to abuse my timepowers nor enough challenge or solid gameplay to constitute a good shooter - in this regard, it didn't achieve either a sandbox I could blow steam off in nor a challenging game I could be engaged in. Instead, it forced me to play it like a shooter with a fun-but-repetitive gimmick I could enjoy every forty seconds - and it doesn't have enough foundation as a shooter to force me into that. F.E.A.R. provides a far more enjoyable experience - in which the time effect, while not as varied - supports a much better game - and one that stands on its own without the gimmick.",-1,1

No. Grab the most overpowered guns in game and hope nobody shpongles charged plasma in your backside.  Cool graphics? Oh well, 2.5 out of 5. Backgrounds and levels are nice and linear, NPC are ugly, and you never see yourself in game. Even hands.  Cool storyline? Err... well, they explained basically nothing.

10130,TimeShift,"If you want a mechanical experience that won't disappoint, but won't thrill, grab Timeshift.  Everything about this game is kind of over sold and under delivered. All of the alternate future weaponry looks cool, but none of it has any weight. The storyline is, to be perfectly blunt, as basic as you can get. A faceless, voiceless protagonist, who follows the orders of a ragtag resistance movement helps them obtain victory during certain engagements leading up to an assault on a walking tower ... fortress thing? This is a game that tries to tell you it's a lot grander in scope than it actually is. The plot has enough holes (not only thanks to time travel, but weird, inconsistant writing) to make the stoy not worth actually listening to, and the levels are rail straight, there's no exploration and very minimal interaction outside of 'Slow time down to bypass this air vent,' ....   In fact, if I look back on the environmental interactivity, I'd be hard pressed to list more than 5 different things you really need time manipulation for, and some of those don't make any sense narratively anyways!   Slow Time: Killing Enemies without getting torn to shreds yourself. This is a must. Cover is barely available and your shields are only able to take one or two shots, while enemies can take half a clip or more to kill, and usually come in waves of 6+.   Slow Time: Avoid Environmental hazard A,B,C etc (Ruptured gas lines on fire, electrified pools)  Slow / Stop Time: Avoide Mechanical Hazard A,B,C etc (Fan blades in a vent, Giant Fan Blade over Chasm, Instant kill Cutting laser security beams, more fans)   Reverse Time: Engadge mechanical system which would let you pass through it into the next section, but only if it were going backwards. Open doors, previously opened by something moving through it so you can pass into the next area. Rinse, repeat.   Here's the thing about time manipulation. If you're going to give a player the ability to slow, stop and rewind time by a Phlebotinum powered onesy, for god's sake give them more than 3 seconds of the power in the middle of their firefights. The amount of suit energy any one power would drain was completely different at different times. They don't even try to explain it. Quote Wikipedia:   The key feature of TimeShift is the player's ability to control time: slowing, stopping or even rewinding time more or less at will. This allows a player to stop time to dodge an incoming projectile or steal an enemy's weapon. Specific time-related puzzles also require these abilities. In some parts of the game the time powers are lengthened.  In some parts, the powers are lengthened. Sweet. Caramel. Zombie. Buckshot.   You can literally walk into an area and be killed within a second by enemies who target you. Using the Slow Time power outside of any pre-approved 'tactical recommendations' from the Timesuit's AI results in your suit power being guzzled faster than you can say 'Out of power, on open ground being shot at by ten enemy characters.'   However, in EXTREMELY similar situations, or in situations where there IS no enemy presence, time slow, time stop and even time reverse powers seem to be magically more power efficient. And let's be clear. We're not talking about a local time shift. We're not talking about alternate universe jumps. This is literally a game where they promise to give you the power to bend time as you want, then tell you for no good reason you can't do it for more than a few seconds, when ten minutes ago, you were making it fifteen minutes ago with enough power left over to charge your fitbit.  Zero crunchy combat, promised time manipulation powers that are as railroading as the envrionments, disappointing, prosaic story. It delivers on the action/shooter front and that is it. If it's on sale, and you want an FPS you can tuck away after 7 hours and never think of again, get it. Otherwise, avoid.  Cheers.",-1,0

Basically unless you can 1hit it with inferior weapons and/or make use of the limited time-manipulation reserves you have (something I wasn't able to do) you can't destroy it - however by backing up for cover you also reset the scene so you have to do all this without running back for shelter from it's rockets.

10130,TimeShift,"Where to even begin. This game is a narrative trainwreck, which sucks because a lot of it has so much potential that you can see rotting on the vine.  First off, this game doesn't handle multiple monitors very well. I've had to turn off my side 2 through nVidia control panel to make it play nice. Every time the game starts up, it opens a little pop up saying I've got incompatible drivers and sends me to nvidia's homepage to download the latest drivers which I already have. Older game, hard to program forward compatibility, but whatever, I can deal with that. Not impressed, but not enough to kill it either.  Gameplay: This is a generic linear corridor shooter with a gimmick of limited time control. You can slow time down, stop time and reverse time. And that's about it. It's not even as much fun as it sounds. What would have been more interesting is an open level approach with multiple solutions, instead of forcing the player down a single path and having the only option to be to shoot everyone. The time control features are introduced within 5 minutes of the opening level, and other than some weapons, that’s about it. The weapons themselves tend to flip flop between underpowered pea-shooter and BFG9000. There’s no character customization, only about 6 weapons total, a few have some alt-fire which is easily ignored and forgotten. A better way of doing this would be a leveling system that lets the player choose how they want to accomplish their objectives: perhaps some would like to do things stealthy, others like the time manipulation tools, still others prefer to load up on heavy armor, big guns, and shoot friends and foes alike until there’s nothing left but smoking ash. Some variety.   The AI is forgettable. They mostly just stand there, or get into poor cover while shouting about what kind of gun you have, request reinforcements, or repeat the same few canned lines again and again and again. They make up for their stupidity in sheer numbers and by killing you in a few shots.  Story wise, don’t even bother. You’re dropping into an alternate timeline around 1939, but might as well be 2100 with all the future tech running around. There’s the generic evil empire vs the good rebels, but I constantly found myself asking “Who are these people and why should I care about any of this.” You see some of the present in flashbacks, but don’t expect it to answer any questions. It might have raised a few questions, but by then I didn’t even care.   Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Deus Ex or Dishonored instead.",-1,0

If you're expecting something like Crysis Power Suit + F.E.A.R. time manipulation, you'll be disappointed.

I normally finish games, but this is unbearably a waste of time.  Rating: 0/10.",-1,0
10130,TimeShift,"Very disappoint after seeing all the praise the game gets for being underrated. Pitiful story, worse gunplay, and gimmicky timeshift mechanics.  First of all, there is no sprint, which wouldn't be a problem but the main character casually walks in the most life threatening situations. You can often die trying to walk to cover when your time powers run out. It tried to make you think about where you should be as you run out of powers but it's more like putting anvils on your shoes and calling it a design choice.  The time powers were also a very big disappoint. Neat concepts but the execution was very poor. The time rewind and time stop use so much power it seems they were only put in to solve the extremely simple time 'puzzles'; such as walking over the millions of electrified puddles. Time slow is about 90% of power usage as it's the only power that gives you any real chance in combat vs more than one soldier.  Now the gunplay isn't the worse I've seen in a game, but the way enemies can soak up about half of a magazine til death makes even the best FPSer turn into a camper while his OP slow time power comes back. I was never a fan of the bullet sponge enemies because it makes combat more gimmicky and campy. Even if you are quicker than the enemy it doesn't matter when you have to go through half a mag to kill one enemy while 2 others are shooting. Combat tends to be either slaughter everyone while in time slow mode then camp to wait for power to come back, or spam grenades for one hit kills then pick up more from their bodies. The only time combat felt somewhat fair outside of time slow was either the ballistic crossbow or sniping headshots, and even then enemies all had pinpoint accuracy from a mile away; and mouse sensitivity is iffy and ignores small movements when zoomed in too far in scope.  The game also doesn't understand what pacing or transitions are. The weapons go from the weakest assault rifle ever made, to the most overpowered weapons. The game goes from frustrating to super easy mode with the one shot crossbow, or infinite ammo boxes with a sniper or rocket launcher next to them. It still ends up being time slow then murder everyone; it just gets easier being able to one shot everyone before they murder you with pinpoint accuracy from a mile away when your time slow runs our and you are out of cover.   I mean, for an old game it isn't as bad as what I've seen, but it definitely doesn't deserve all the praise when it really is just semi-unique and but a very gimmicky one trick pony",-1,0
10130,TimeShift,"TLDR: Basic Story. Linear. Minimal Bugs. Average Voice Acting. Great Gameplay. Basic Puzzles. Good Level Design. Short Campaign. Nice Graphics for old game. 7/10.  Basic Story with a few confusing cut scenes of some naked woman didn't detract from the gameplay (Nudity rarely detracts). The first level or so were a bit so so but the game takes off after that. The game didn't go excessive on using TimeShifting for puzzles but from time to time it required it and worked well.  Puzzles weren't exactly genius in design but they were effective enough to make you think a few times through the game.  The best part of the game was the combat.  Your TimeShifting powers are:  Slow Time: Faster Reflexes where everyone and everything else is slowed down for a moderate duration  Stop Time: Everything is completely halted except you of course so you can lodge bullets or explosive darts into a troop of enemies and unpause to watch them all die instantaneously and do synchronised backflips or giblet explosions.  Reverse Time: Rewinds a short duration of time to send everything back in time to save yourself from imminent death but mostly used for puzzles.  Not a Long game but worth buying if on special. I don't usually have the concentration to finish any games these days but this one was short and sweet enough for me to enjoy... I paid $3.75 on special and the game is worth probably around that region due to it's short campaign.  There are minor little 'bugs' throughout the game but more of a polish issue but this didn't detract from the game either.  The voice acting wasn't aweful but not perfect either, often the response to enemy comrade deaths was a bit weak 'He's dead' in an unsurprised manner... But nothing that seems too cheap.. Just a little.  The TimeShift abilities work perfectly and that is what ties the game together.  This game is 7 years old so the graphics aren't superb but I actually liked them. 3D light affected textures. Excellent ragdoll physics and there is plenty of gore too!  It wasn't particularly memorable and very linear but this game wasn't meant to be open world.  I'll give it a 7/10.  A little more polish, a deeper story and tad more emmersive environments.. Maybe a tad longer game would have made it a 9/10.",1,0

10130,TimeShift,Under-rated for a reason!,-1,0
10130,TimeShift,"Not enjoyable. It takes around two mags to kill someone. Two hours into the game I started wondering if any of my abilities would get better (damage increase, better guns, time altering length extensions, armor). When slowing, stopping and rewinding time, it feels like the meter bar, for the amount of altering time you have left, drains way too fast to the point of why is this feature even in the game. Every time I went to a box that has the blue lasers covering the weapon in it, I thought I would get a better gun, but it would always just be more ammo. You'll have to worry about ammo either, it's everywhere. I didn't even know why I was fighting in the story, (Might just be my own problem) they just didn't make it interesting enough to want to know what's going on.",-1,1
10130,TimeShift,"Very average shooter, but with some interesting mechanics. Sadly the time-shifting abilities are only used to solve puzzles or as a 'bullet time' to pick off enemies, I really hoped they would have designed the game better around them. Taking them away leaves you with a bland shooter, nothing to write home about and a completely forgettable storyline, plus boring environments and level design. Not recommended, I'd give it maybe a 6/10 cause I still somewhat had fun and the weapons are quite cool. Nice gore effects also.",-1,1
10130,TimeShift,**WARNING**  There is no multiplayer for this game. Gamespy killed it just like so many other games. I was not even able to create a listen server locally to host a server for directy connect. This game for all intents and purposes is single player only.,-1,0
10130,TimeShift,"A slow and derivative slog. Your health comes back so quickly that you never feel like you're in danger. However, enemies soak up a half-dozen shots to the chest before dying, so you don't feel powerful either. Killing them doesn't feel like victory, it feels like a chore. The time powers are uninspired and not particularly useful.  And it's ripping off Half-Life 2 in a way that just feels pathetic. You fight battle-robots alongside The Rebels in a bombed out European city while the Evil Scientist President harangues you from a giant tv screen. You even run down a canal while baddies shoot at you from up on the walls!  Don't waste your time on this.  ",-1,0
10130,TimeShift,"Abominably bad, one of my biggest gaming disppointments. Do not buy.  EDIT: Finally struggled through to the endgame. A few thoughts:   - Story blatantly rips off Half Life 2, while somehow missing the pacing and depth that were the worthy parts to steal.  - Gameplay can flow nicely, but quickly becomes repetitive.  - Terrible level design.  - Graphics make Deus Ex's look modern.  - Pathetic AI.  - All the characters are 1-dimensional.  There is no challenge in this game. The time control mechanics make regular combat insultingly easy, even against the enhanced enemies. By the end I was just breezing through the fights. Ideally the story would have compensated for the boredom, but no luck there. The endgame was a cutscene, no payoff, no interaction. Just headshot, ity bye. Overall, a wasted opportunity.",-1,0

10130,TimeShift," Edit: I finished the game, to check if that review was made too hastly. It is not; I stand by my point: this game sucks, and I am pretty sure that the reason why bad reviews are systematically poorly noted is that there are people who's interest is to sel... erm, downvote bad reviews of that game. DO NOT BUY. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME.   I expect this review to be poorly noted (around 0%, maybe a bit more if I'm lucky to be read by someone honest), just like ANY other bad review on this game (I won't write here what are my takes on 'why', I let the reader figure out by himself why ALL the bad reviews on this game are poorly noted, whatever they may contain).  This game is not a pretty game. It's from 2007 but looks like it was from the early 2000 (LOTS of bump mapping, low-def textures, bad animations, very low poly models, etc. - I'm, of course, running the game on 'best' settings for everything; and honestly, as pointed out by one of my contacts, it's not due to the engine, which is pretty solid for the epoch, but rather to the lack of artistical direction, and very poor graphical choices). This game isn't a fun game either: the gameplay is utterly repetitive, the immersion is inexistent, there is no challenge either, and the time-based mechanics are interesting for a few minutes at best.  The player is left without any instruction, without any guidance on how to use the controls, without any background story, without anything that can help immerison, or interest: to imagine what playing this game is, just imagine downloading a random indie FPS with funny, unusual controls, with a random map, and stupid A.I., and you'll get close to what that game is.  I haven't played enough to give more insight about that crap, but I surely regret having spent 5 bucks into that. There are PLENTY of better games to buy, from Singularity (that also features some time-control mechanics) to Hard Reboot, and so on. Don't waste your time (especially) or money on that one, not worth it by any extent.",-1,0
10130,TimeShift,"So far I honestly regrett having bought this game. It's just unnatural. Starts with the default key bindings which are far off from what the average FPS is using: Zooming in is done with 'e', a melee attack by clicking the mouse wheel, the powers use awkward keys. There is no sprint, you get slightly faster additionally when slowing down time, but energy recovery is far too slow. On 'Skilled', it takes up to three shots with a shotgun to the head if they enemy's wearing a helmet. I fire away an entire mag with the assault rifle to the body. Luckily you get a lot of ammo, however you still heavily depend on using your time shifting abilities. But as said, the energy recovers way too slowly for such a heavy use.  You don't get any information on who you are are what the  even happened. You suddenly appear in 1939 of an alternative world where a high tech civil uprising takes place instead of WWII. It's just your standard, linear, straight-forward FPS with special abilities in which difficulty doesn't mean a more human-like AI, but rougher enemies with increased health and armor and more bullets for you to take. As always, you're the uber-soldier, although I had the impression that actually you're a ing scientist... since when can I, as a scientist, remorselessly kill people and even fire a damn gun so precisely?!

10130,TimeShift,"Timeshift is an interesting game. The mechanic of controlling the flow of time offers a rather unique and interesting perspective on the first person shooter, and this is where timeshift shines. An enemy is firing at me.

It's good that this freedom of choice is around, as the plot leaves something to be desired. The story is rather bland and not very fleshed out, the characters are dry and sometimes annoying, and the AI can be nothing short of stupid at times. Regardless, the game is fun.

10150,Prototype,"Take on the role of Alex Mercer, a man who has no recollection of what’s happened to him or why, or how he came to acquire the shape-shifting powers he now possesses. Find the people who’ve done that to you and make them pay. The game -action, adventure, open worldish- sounded fun and looked fun, and I was very hyped to play it. I was also very disappointed when I finally did. Controls, though a bit wonky, are not difficult. You can change your body “at will” to attack enemies and destroy things, and when I say “at will” I mean you only have so many things you can change into. I think the most fun aspect of the game is the fact that you can ‘consume’ random people and then turn into them, and run/jump your way around pretty freely.   I’d say the graphics are dated, but it’s an oldish game, so it gets a slight pass for that. What it doesn’t get a pass for, however, is the  performance. For a 2009 game that should run like a charm on my computer, it sure worked like crap even at the lowest settings, lagging worse than Assassin’s Creed III - and at least that one had a reason to lag (no “low” video settings, hey). I’m also not particularly fond of the reddish/orangeish filter they use on later cinematics and gameplay time, I find it bothersome to look at.   Your character is overpowered, which is not bad in itself if you like an easy game, but it does make things boring after a while as it’s all the same; to tell the truth, it reminded me a little of God Hand for some reason, only that one was actually fun to keep playing. With Prototype, I did the first few missions and was bored out of my mind - that along with the slightly eye-hurting graphics and slight, random spikes of lag made the game truly disappointing.  The gameplay is pretty repetitive otherwise. Fight a bunch of bad guys, have them call in tanks and an airstrike, be chased, shake them off, rinse and repeat with a moderate variety of enemies and mutants to fight against.   It’s not a completely unplayable game, mind you. If you’re extremely bored and want to play something that doesn’t pose a huge challenge, it’s not a bad game and could even be considered entertaining. I liked the city, the chance to explore it some, the general idea of the game was good (though the story was a bit hit and miss with me), but the execution left a lot to be desired.  Perhaps if the game had lagged a bit less I would have enjoyed it a bit better.  I wouldn’t recommend this game, but I would certainly not tell you to steer clear from it either, as I feel it could be a lot more fun if you can actually play it sans the lag.",-1,1
10150,Prototype,"Prototype has its ups and downs, but more downs that ups. The main character has some super fun super powers that allow you to do some really crazy things as you fly, jump, or run (horizontally and vertically) through the city.The game also looks pretty good. The story seems really fascinating as well, but that's about where the good ends.   First off, the city gets pretty boring pretty quickly as there is nothing really unique about the city that makes any part of the city look any different from another part. I found myself just following the quest markers on the mini map and not trying to learn the city at all. I never knew where I was unless I pulled up the main map. There are lots of cool powers, but when the fights get going you are so busy running around trying to stay alive and kill that you never really get any time to really bask in the fun of watching a cool ability when it is triggered.   The main negative is that it appears that the controls for the PC port didn't translate properly. The keyboard presses are super sensitive. I've been using this keyboard for a few years and dozens of games, so I am comfortable with it, but I never had such problems with the keyboard in any other game than I did with Prototype. To top it off there was no sweetspot for mouse sensitivity either. Either it took HUGE hand sweeps to turn left and right, with the mouse, or my camera would go sitr crazy at the slightest twitch when trying to adjust the sensitivity. Also y-axis sensitivity was way more sensitive than the x-axis.    As a result, I could barely control my character as I bounced off walls, hitting things, or attacking things except the actual mob I had selected as my target. My character looked cool going bat crap crazy all over the fight zone, but if this game had been real life, the people I was fighting would have thought I was an idiot as they easily gunned me down, which is what happened during game play very often. I eventually got so ultra  at the lack of character control that I finally quit and removed the game from my system. Experiencing the story wasn't enough of a draw to make me spend many frustrating hours getting killed constantly and wander through a boring city. I'll read the story on Wikipedia or something.",-1,0

10150,Prototype,"Prototype is an action-adventure open world game. You are Alex Mercer, a man without memory armed with amazing superhuman powers and the option to go most anywhere you like and do most anything you want once you get there. A virus outbreak has claimed Manhattan, forcing the island into a military quarantine. The infected citizens turning the population into mutants. The main story path is entirely linear. The missions are a sloppy mix of poorly paced ideas. Long missions involve simply going from one end of Manhattan to the other, while some of the short missions are climactic sieges and battles. Missions can be brutally challenging, often because of the uncooperative auto-lock system. Boss battles are much longer than they need to be and more often test your endurance rather than your skill. As you work your way through the game, you will earn experience points that can be used to unlock new and ever more exotic powers. Experience points are also the only thing you get by finding collectibles. The graphics are not the best, buildings and environments are ugly, so the world is not a place you want to explore.  All in all, the awful boring and repeating missions and linear gameplay ruins the overall experience.

10150,Prototype,"This game sucks.  Want an in-depth review why this game sucks? I found the sound messed up really hard so I could barely hear the dialogue when there was any. It didn't stop me from understanding the story, but it did  me off. The story is boring. It's a typical amnesiac with super powers trying to figure out the past. I liked it better when it was the Bourn Identity.  Gameplay started out funny but immediately got stale. I really don't care for stealth missions and I didn't see a need for them in this game, but it went ahead &amp; gave me stealth missions anyway. The whole thing felt poorly balanced. You're this super ultra killing machine and there's always a seemingly infinite number of soldiers on the screen all spread out shooting at you at all times and you're trying to kill enough guys to keep regenerating health. Then they introduce these mutant alien things that take for god damn ever to kill. I got really tired of fighting those things after about the 28th time.  You can steal vehicles, but it wasn't really adding anything to the gameplay. About 8 or so missions in, I just got bored of the game and decided this wasn't worth finishing. I was on normal and I started out laughing like 'hahaha this is so easy' to having a heart attack trying to finish a mission. I get that there were more super powers to upgrade, they seemed mostly useless from the description. The novelty of the game wears off after about half an hour or so. It just didn't seem like it was worth finishing.",-1,0

10150,Prototype,"Having looked through my reviews on steam, to see which had been helpful, I noticed my review for Prototype had only 2/7 upvotes. Since my free trial on PS Now has just run out, to get over my craving for infamous, I decided to look for games like it on PC. Prototype was the closest thing people could come up with, so I redownloaded it.  I forgot why I disliked this game so much. But as I said before, the controls were off, the camera was dodgy and the graphics were poor even when I had disabled some things to get it above 30fps and downloaded a fix for the resolution cap of 720p.  The controls feel like they were made for a controller, and it is trying to take the same input from a keyboard and mouse, but one of the most infuriating things is how aiming moves requires an analogue stick and so it is very difficult to aim attacks. Also, the camera changes sensitivity depending on what is happening, which may be alright for someone experienced with a controller, but with a mouse it is the height of frustration.  Also, whilst I suppose people who only use one monitor may not be bothered by the resolution, it is forcibly set to 30fps and 720p which is not only annoying, but it makes the game unplayable in many situations.  Once you have fixed the resolution and frame rate cap, and gotten used to the controls, I suppose the game is ok. I don't remember the story from when I spent most of my time in it, but that doesn't mean it is bad. The graphics are poor (not aged well in my opinion, still rather polygonal in some areas, and flat textures trying to mimic rough textures), apart from abilities which look rather cool because they are meant to be black masses. I don't like the gameplay enough to play for long periods of time, although the carnage you are capable of wreaking is fun in short bursts.  I wouldn't buy this game, as it isn't story heavy so I can't see any problem with getting prototype 2 if you have to have a game like this. If you want a game like infamous, as I do, I guess the best course of action would be getting better internet and paying for PS Now, which isn't that tempting (as it costs quite a lot, and you have to pay that amount every month with no discount for buying several months in the UK)",-1,0

The combat overall feels tightly paced, what with all the recovery animations and slow-mo, but I never really felt it was overdone.

I myself is a mix of both, plus I also like to be creative when it comes to throw things after other things. Ever tried throwing a car at a helicopter? In Prototype you will do it all the time!

As fun as it is listening to Alex Mercer go on about how he needs to find some answers over and over again is, I'd much rather gouge my eardrums out with a grapefruit spoon. (or just play it on mute. that works too...)  That being said, the only solace that makes up for the rest of the pile of unspeakable that is this game, is the fact that the power curve is flawless. Something about running down a new york street at 40 mph, vaulting over cars and trucks alike, then jumping and clearing a 30 story building just to start running up the side of the empire state building, doing a flying leap off, and bullet diving into the earth so hard that the entire black turns to shambles is entertining, if not extremely satisfying.

You run about eating people, things, things that used to be people etc, while rapidly evolving to become more powerful and gain the memories you've lost. The gameplay involves the use of superpowers, basic vahicle mechanics and guns, which - excepting the guns - all work pretty well. The powers you gain along the course of the game are, as they should be, much better than the ones you get in the first 30 minutes, with things like the extendo-tentecale and blade basically rendering everything else obselete, so the game progresses fairly well. Overall it's pretty great game, although other hack and slashers have bested it I still hold firm to the fact that I've believed since it's release, in that it's probably the best superpowers based game ever.",1,0
10150,Prototype,Great fun game to play. You get to be ausome and do heaps of cool fighting moves. Best to play with an xbox controller. A good port to teh PC and easy to get teh hang off.  Good storyline and graphics arent bad considering this game is a few years old. If you can get it on special its woth the money. Also quite long so you will get heaps out of it.,1,0

10150,Prototype,"Although the boss battles in this game are sometimes really annoying and long, this game makes up for it by allowing you to kill innocent bystanders in the most gruesome ways possible.

10150,Prototype,This is the ultimate game if you're REALLY angry and need to blow off some steam.  Manager  you off? Go grab a taxicab and throw it at a helicopter. Price of gas go up? Take a tank and blow up a gas station. Friend talking behind your back? 'Absorb' an enemy and shoot all his squadmates.  Basically it's a huge sandbox built for killing stuff in really weird and fun ways. I have found it very therapeutic.,1,0

10150,Prototype,"Crap port, good game. Certainly one of the more entertaining mass-murder simulators I've played. How many games have you played where you can kill and old lady, eat her, take on her form, run up the tallest building in the city and perform a dive bomb that turns half a city block into jam?",1,0
10150,Prototype,"This game has a nice execution. But is poor on the story, and amazingly for a game that lets you elbow drop onto a tank from a skyscraper, it does nothing to embrace it's emergent capabilities. And once the novel factor wears off it turns repetitive.  The game deserves a premise for that single novel factor, though don't expect nothing after groundbraking, or surprising. Missions are too long and repetitive and the characthers are there to fill in the gaps. Also there's zombies.",1,0
10150,Prototype,"Overall a fun game.    The story is basically resident evil.. virus outbreak although unlike it you are insanely overpowered even on hard diff..    I like the fact that you fight both the military and the infected however the AI on the military is just sad you can literally do the most insane  right in front of them and they won't react never mind the fact that you are obviously not human or that you are supposed to be a 'priority target' even if you do get in trouble you can kill all of them or evade them without much of a struggle.    The infected are even less of a threat then the military. Once you learn the move set of the enemy they become closer to tedious then to a challenge including what is supposed to be bosses which just take more time to kill and are still easy to evade sins you are extremely fast.    Apart from the protagonist characters somehow don't feel complete.    The gameplay is pretty cool. Basically you are very fast and agile. Most of the time you will be jumping from one rooftop to another. Has a good variety of weapons and powers and you can even steal tanks and helicopters from the military and use them to your advantage. The stealth system is just about the only thing i dislike in the gameplay sins all the NPC's are blind, deaf and suffer from a rare disorder in which their mind goes blank and forget everything every 5 seconds or they might as well be in a coma.    I'd go ether way with the recommendation depends on what you want to play.  Even with all the issues it has it is still fun to go fight endless waves of enemies and see how long you are going to last. That is until you learn how to heal up fast and that the waves are not actually endless...",1,0
10150,Prototype,"Fun game, played it on all systems it was released for and PC is by far my favorite even with the graphics bug that is present in the game. Overall a fun experience with an interesting story, and mechanic of unlocking the story, that builds up to a natural finale.   While the characters are sometimes bland and the main is a bit of an emo crybaby at times, the gameplay is still very interesting and is greatly improved upon in the sequel despite the story taking a turn. Overall it's a good game but I wouldn't hold out for it being ground breaking or revolutionary.  8/10  Pros: Fun gameplay Large open area Interesting story Can throw old people at helicopters.  Cons: Bland characters Main character is a literal god (his codename is Zeus) but acts like he's powerless for the first bit of the game. No replayabilitiy Collectibles (unless you're into that)",1,0
10150,Prototype,"This is a game that really shows it's age. AI is pretty poor. Storytelling method is pretty cool but the story itself is kind of a mess, with random event after event making a shaky framework to tie the missions together. No real character development ever, which just makes it so funny when they reveal Mercer's sins and try to paint him as a tragic victim after he brutally murders and eats thousands of people. The dialogue is almost laughably cliche sometimes. Controls can be pretty finnicky resulting in some frusterating moments.   Dispite that, it's quite fun to play. You get an aresenal of powers, and you get to be a sort of antihero as you run around town killing people and fighting abominations. I think the central game mechanics are pretty solid and well executed, and that was enough for me to play it through and reccomend it.",1,0
10150,Prototype,"I always wondered if this game was good or not since I first heard of it years ago. Yet, in the end it's really not that speical. The story is weak and a complete button masher. I don't mind button mashers but the story should at least be stronger than what is presented. The plot is simple and boring but the idea of the story is good. It was just poorly brought out. Even though I can play almost any game, I feel that I would have to force myself to get through this one. If I wanted to play a game similar to this, but better, I would play InFamous. Yet, I can not complain too much about the game. The idea and upgrades are cool. It's fun if you want to cause complete chaos with your overpowered character, but that's it.",-1,0
10150,Prototype,"There isn't a lot to be said about this game that hasn't already been said, seeing as how it's a few years old now. It's a great game, with a ton of intense fighting and fun action. I can't even begin to tell you how rewarding it is to get home from a hard day, turn on Prototype, and beat/cut/slice/spash the @#$% out of everything. Definitely a lot of fun for causing beautiful bloody mayhem, but with a surprisingly good plot as well. The graphics aren't the most beautiful in the world, but they're pretty good. Just don't be expecting Skyrim-quality graphics, or you'll be sadly disappointed. But if you want a fun hack n' slash where everything bleeds rivers and your arm turns into a sword/whip/sledgehammer, this is the perfect game for you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  If you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

10150,Prototype,"Don't get me wrong, the game has a good side.  This is one that I just do not feel a drive to complete. The story is kind of flat, and the camera is insane. Controls get a bit wonky when the camera does things.  Were I playing this back when I was all about superhero games, probably would not bother me as much(I really enjoyed the first Spiderman on N64 and Dreamcast). It is a decent concept, and my kids enjoy free running and smashing things. It is not a bad game, just a bit flawed and kind of boring to me.  On sale, I think it is a decent budget game for low spenders who want a lot of playtime for the money.  I have a ton of games, this one is not making a priority among them. I would rather rate it Up than Down, but only because it is a working game with a story and system. This is not one of my favorite titles.",1,0
10150,Prototype,"I would recommend this to anyone who loves free-roam games, blood, strong violence and just all out mayhem!  An amazing tutorial which pretty much puts you in god mode at the beginning of the game so you can learn the controls which are extremely easy to use! Rich and telling storyline which keeps you gripped all the way to the very end.  Alex Mercer is probably the best Antogonist/Protagonist ever!! 9/10 (Grenade launcher spam at the later stages is quite annoying)",1,0
10150,Prototype,"I recently got Prototype 1 and 2 on sale and luckily I managed to get Prototype 1 to work as I had an old pc that I had not got around to throwing out. The specs are Intel Pentium D 3.5 GHz, 3.5gigs of ram and an Nvidia GeForce 9400 GT card.  There were audio problems that I could not get rid of during cut scenes but otherwise the audio was fine during gameplay.  Overall despite the bugs I really enjoyed the game and I think it is great considering when it was made so IF you have the computer specs to get Prototype 1 to work I would recommend buying it on sale. I also highly recommend Prototype 2 as it is the best open world chaos and destruction game I have ever played.",1,0

10150,Prototype,"Okay this game is good now i say that as in its not bad, but could be better. And how they couldve improved on that is the story. Now the story to me its not quite clear what your main objective is because might i say Alex is a bit of a dumba$$ but we will forgive him, buit not knowing exactly what your main goal is, is...just not quite right but its still okay and pretty interesting of course leaving out the part of alex being an idiot. But then there are the cutscenes, the cutscenes with alex in them makes them confusing, not complicated just confusing because alex has the IQ of a rock his dialog is......not on the inteligent side making it hard to follow the storyline now for JUST THE STORY i would give it like a 7 or a 7.5 strictly because of how dumb alex is. But at this point youd be like ew bad story i dont want to sit through that. Well learning the fact that after you beat one mission you get more bada$$ powers drives you to want to play the story more. So if you want this game buy it more in the idea of your going to run around and kill people with awseome powers and upgrades not in the aspect of the story that much.

10150,Prototype,"BEFORE I REVIEW! If you are having FPS problems. Try this. 1.) Open Device manager. 2.) Start DISABLING, and not DELETING your HIDs. (Aka the ones that look like 'HID-compliant ~etc) 3) Re-enable them after you stop playing.  This fixed my issue. Hopefully it fixes yours, should you have it. &lt;3  Review: Pros: + Combat is absolutely brillaint.  + Gameplay feels smooth. + Things despawn at a very slow rate. For example: You can set a helicopter down at one end of the map. Run to another end and back and find it right where you left it. + You have character appropriate abilities. + Violent, and gory. Very, very graphic. (If you enjoy gory games.) + There's an option to replay the campaign with previous campaigns unlocks. &lt;3  Cons: - Graphics are a little dated. Max resolution is 1280/800. - Story is short, and a little lacking. - Entire game is essentially a copy of Radical's: 'The Incredible Hulk. Ultimate Destruction.' - Very gory, and violent. (If you dislike, or are disturbed by gore.) - Voice acting was bad. (Though better than the second game, I will mention.) - End game feels repetitive. You run around killing the same hunters, soldiers. Destroying the same bases, and hives. After you're fully upgraded. End game Prototype feels a lot like endgame GTA. You just run around and kill things.  If you played the Hulk Game I mentioned in the Cons. Then realizing the fact that it was essentially copy pasted from that game will ruin most the experience for you. Though if it is on sale. I would pick it up.",1,0

Top it off with heapings of diverse side-quests and the ever-growing feeling that you are a god among men (mere ants, really, as far as Alex Mercer is concerned) and you're in for a wicked good time. It's also consumable in small bursts - two to three hours seems to be my average session time - which you might appreciate if you're the working type.",1,0

10150,Prototype,"Prototype is the kind of game that shows how bad and destructive one can be. As some type of genetic superbeing, you are free to explore the city of New York any way you like. Have fun killing people, destroy the bases of the police/military or just look around for sidemissions and things to collect. In between you do a story mission to advance the plot and gain new abilities. By the end of the game you are almost unstoppable. The free world to explore, the many sidequests, awesome powers and interesting story with some twisted elements make this game a solid title.",1,0

10150,Prototype,"Gameplay works, it's fun as hell and the powers are inventive. Your effectly 'The Thing' you able to perfectly replicate any person and your body can be shaped and twised into devestating weapons on the fly. Along with that, Movement is smooth and responsive, besides a few hiccups, it was after all one of the games that defined the super hero sandbox. The story, though bland gets the job done, but it's what had me stop playing. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game and worth the 20 bucks if you buy it not on sale, it's just I could not buy the protangoists 'anti-hero' angle the story was trying the sell me...which causes the rest to fall apart as they attempted to make the enemies you fight 'Blackwatch' so sterotypcially evil might as well give them snidely whiplash mustaches and kick puppies. To be fair I am only 13 hours into the game so I don't know how far I got into the story, but still..I am recomending it as game to buy..just that little problem I had with the story stacked up enough to where I didn't want to play anymore. Eh maybe someday I can come back and complete it.",1,0
10150,Prototype,"Activision's prototype for a game with no play-testing. Controls are sloppy and often confusing. Difficulty curve is all over the map: some 'hard' events are trivial and other 'easy' ones are nearly impossible. Story had real potential but is too fragmented by the sandbox gameplay constantly disrupting it.  Worth maybe $2.50 or so if you can grab it on sale, but really...just get Saint's Row 4 instead. They took all the best and fun movement from Prototype and un-f*cked the rest of the game so people could actually enjoy it.",1,0
10150,Prototype,"Awesome game, it reminds me of the Spiderman games, more so Web of Shadows than the other games. It's fluid in controls and really fun to play. There's multiple aspects to the game and it lets you create your own playstyle. Like sensing your opponents and then bashing their heads in? It has that. Like blindly slicing your way through crowds for fun? It has that. Do you like shooting people? It has that too. There's a variety of different ways to play and it lets you choose your own style which I like a lot. The different power-ups and upgrades alone are what should keep you playing, with each added power it gives you more freedom to do things the way you want to.",1,0

10150,Prototype,"To start, the port of the game is acceptable. The game's highest resolution setting is 720p, and the graphics certainly aren't very impressive for a 2009 PC game. InFAMOUS looks better on PS3 really, and it came out at the exact same time. I played this game with a controller, so I can not tell you if the mouse and keyboard controls work well. The controls with a controller are alright. They aren't as precise as I'd like, but their good enough to keep the gameplay enjoyable. I experienced a couple crashes, but the game was fairly stable overall.  The gameplay is better than the port and is a nice bit of mindless fun. You can slice, throw, crush, and consume people by the dozen. The homicidal maniac within the player will have a blast butchering helpless soldiers for quite a while. However, eventually your inner homicidal maniac will realize there's nothing else to do but kill kill kill, and he or she will begin to grow tired of the indiscriminate mass murder. You'll probably reach this point before you finish the game, especially after half the enemies become super soldiers, large mutants, tanks, and various other enemies that will knock you about stunning you constantly and throwing you around like a baseball among a group of American children. Getting around the city is quite enjoyable. There's just something satisfying about jumping 50 feet into the air and gliding around New York, but this also begins getting old with time.   The story is forgetable, but if you're buying a game where you play as a superpowered mass murderer for story, then you're clearly looking in the wrong place.  This game fills a good few hours with hack and slash joy, but outstays its welcome. I'd recommend you get it on sale.",1,0
10150,Prototype,"Played the game, beat the game, what do I think?  My Pros, Driving story, excellent open world motion, you wouldn't believe how fast you can hoof it from one end of the city to the other, and I love the feeling of being just plain unstoppable. The game still had moments where I had to run, rethink, and try a new angle, so this isn't blind button mashing. Some good challanges for practice, or just a break between missions is nice as well.  My Cons I'm not a fan of the harsh language, i.e. get ready for a lot of military speak. And the stealth parts feel a bit easy, especially with the stealth consume perk. Thank goodness stealth is not what this game is about. More like a little seasoning.  My Overall feeling. Loved the game for that satisfying 'Unleash the Beast' feeling. Definite recommend.",1,0

10150,Prototype,"'I can be anything... Become anyone... Absorbing every memory untill I can remember who I am... And who...Deserves my wrath.'   Somehow I missed this game in 2009 and found it only in 2014. And now, after I've completed it, I can easily say that 'Prototype' is one of my favourite games.  Of course it's nothing more than a simple slasher, if you judge by gameplay. But somehow it's still very interesting to play. I personally like the storyline. Love it so bad! I can feel the anger of the Alex Mercer, a man who has lost everything - his girlfriend, his sister, his memories. But he gained strange powers and lead by them he can restore everything. At least he can try. And he unleashes his anger upon his enemies, upon everyone who stays on his way.  Like that you go through the game, becoming more and more awesome. More powerful. More invincible. More cruel. You're getting closer to your goal and every person you consume helps you to reveal the truth.   Who released the virus? Who did this to Alex Mercer? And can you fix all of this?  Play 'Prototype' and find out. ",1,0
10150,Prototype,"This game is game beyond gods, it's is action packed with a bit of difficulty. The story is amazing and gameplay is better. The abilities, weapons, creatures, everything!

10150,Prototype,"This game starts off pretty good, but then the developers seem to run out ideas and just throw you into small arenas and fill it with monsters. The final missiosn are just like: Kill 5 of these, then kill 5 more, then kill 4 more, then kill 6 more, then kill a final 7 more. The next mission is the same thing with different kind of thing you need to kill. It is just a slog after a while. Prototype 2 is much better although far from perect.",1,0

10150,Prototype,"A story? Yeah, there's one here somewhere. But what's more fun is jumping around a simulated New York City with superpowers during a zombie/viral outbreak. Plays better with a gamepad than on keyboard/mouse, which makes it slightly less than a great game. Attention publishers/developers: if your game is going on a PC, make sure to spend the money to make the controls PC specific, not just a direct mapping from the gamepad controls.",1,0

10150,Prototype,"If you're a fan of sand-box games, I can recommend picking this one up when it's on sale. It's a mess of an experience and tries to pad itself with missions that require you to repeat activities or run across the world just to show off the fact you can fly about with gore shoowing out of your wrists. Mercer is completely unsympathetic, and the story collapses on itself when you think about it for more than five seconds.  But it's fun. There's something primal about dropping down into a group of twenty soldiers and just tearing them apart before devouring their commander so you can call down artillery on their heads. It's ultimately ironic when they give you all these powers and upgrades, it's impossible to use nearly any of them because of how predators hunt you down and rockets home in on your location. Often missions devolve into hiding behind buildings, eating civs and waiting for a chance to rush back in and deal a littel damage. The bosses are definitely the low part of the game; they are all immune to even your basic attacks and it comes down to cheesing your way to victory.  Glad I played it, because it really helps me appreciate where games have come from and where they are going. Sort of Infamous' lesser brother.",1,0

10150,Prototype,The game plays in New York where a virus broke out. You play as Alex Mercer who lost his mind. He's also infected and he has some special abilites or rather mutations. You can move free around New York and must complete missions. You can also upgrade yourself with exp which you are gaining through fights. I like the movment you can jump high and upgrade your abilites so that you can even fly a short time and it's just awesome to move from one skyscraper to another :D  This is a really cool game and even after you finished this game you can still move around the city and play just for fun. :),1,0
10150,Prototype,"Lots of violence and a vast array of abilities to choose, upgrade, and unlock although the game does look and feel old. Being Alex Mercer is a bit like being both Spiderman and Venom at the same time but not much more than that. If you like feeling like an invincible superhero with many extraordinary abilities to use to creatively kill your enemies/civilians, get this game.",1,0
10150,Prototype,"This is only a first impression, but from what I have played, this game is what you get if you take the concept of Kirby and suck every last ounce of innocence out of it. Not to mention adding a whole lot of bloody mess rather then clean 'inhaling' as it were.   Its -kinda- typical third persion actiony title, but the fact that you're a Parkour People Eater (My offical term for Alex Mercer) gives it that different edge that keeps it interesting. The fact you can be jumping from rooftop to rooftop one moment, to sneaking past security by eating someone with the right clearence the next, and then hacking your way through horrible monstrosities with your giant claw arms after that keeps the game interesting and enjoyable.",1,0

It will challenge you quiet a lot come later in the game, especially when you have to fight some of the harder bosses in the late game - even with almost every upgrade possible unlocked I still died multiple damn times on the last few bosses cause of their power and being targeted by over hundreds of things at once (&gt;.&lt;).

10150,Prototype,3rd person hack and slash with a unique delivery. At it's core it's essentially an expanded version of a 'light light heavy' type of combo system but with the movement physics and the environment structure you can effectively chain an infinite number of attacks switching on the fly between attack forms all while darting from rooftop to street to helicopter to street to gliding high above the streets to wherever you feel like it.

10150,Prototype,"This game was... alot better then I expected! I'm usually not keen on the whole 'invincable killing machine' but this one was really fun. The powers worked though I usually prefered to use military weapons over them usually but thats just my preference. Theres alot to do but its its not too impossable which I like. The story is ok but you really don't get very interested in the life of Alex Mercer. Still, I really enjoy the fact that there are so many cutscenes! I have never seen a game with so many mini cutscenes. So this game is loads of fun and I can't wait to play the next one! This is a must play!",1,0

Anyway, Alex Mercer is a badass, and there is something wrong with you if you don't enjoy jumping over Manhattan like everything's a giant trampoline, via what parkour wants to be when it grows up.

Go on a rampage and destroy everything. See how far across the city you can throw random civilians. Eat those same civilians for health.  Scream obsecnities when you get caught in that stupid obnoxious melee combo that Hunters use. Hate the game because animation canceling doesn't work unless you're an NPC.  Don't forget to abuse the blade arm on tanks, super soldiers, and hunters. Works best from the air.  7/10",1,0

There's a lot of side missions available beside main ones. The whole city of New-York is modeled and you can find missions everywhere in there. You can spend a lot of time before getting bored, but ... some could get bored before finishing the main scenario.
